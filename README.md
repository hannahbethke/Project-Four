# Project Four

One of the biggest appeals of attending a concert is to surround yourself with people that share a common passion in the music you love. Unfortunately, sometimes when you bring friends along with you, they arenâ€™t always as familiar with the artist as you and nothing is more depressing than singing your heart out to a song at a concert, just to see those around you have no idea what song you are listening to.

This app will help solve this problem by allowing a user to generate a suggested playlist consisting of songs of the artists that you would like to see.

If people can hear the songs before the concert, it will maximize their concert-going experiences and help you and your friends bond closer than ever!
